HackerRank Solutions in Python3
======

This is an attempt to learn Python3 by completing challenges on [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/).The purpose here is to review coding challenges while learning a new languages.I am still new to the data structures in Python, so some of the solutions may be a little less than elegant:-)I hope to make a second pass to improve upon the code one I get more familure.

This Readme table of contents/progress is autogenerated.See [util](util/) directory for the tools used to do so, and [util/README.md](util/README.md) for script execution order.
